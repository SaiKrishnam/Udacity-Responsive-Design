1.@import--very bad perfomance , so avoid it
2.@media--few large http requests
3.link stylesheets--many small http requests

--->Most famous media queries----1. min-width,max-width (based on size of browser window)

others like below are strongly discouraged(based on size of device)

2.max-device-width

-->How many breakpoints and where is very important for any site ?????

@media screen and [write css width with 'and']

-->flex helps make responsive design ,
parentdiv{
display: flex
} (3divs in a parent div) then the 3 divs will not wrap and instead resize irrespective of size of viewport.
flex-wrap:wrap , will wrap to next line .

flex can change order of elements using 'order' attribute.

.css-class{order:4}
